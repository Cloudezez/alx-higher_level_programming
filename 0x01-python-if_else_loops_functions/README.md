0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX Higher-Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on the fundamental concepts of control flow in Python, including if/else statements, loops, and functions. By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to structure Python programs and utilize control flow to solve problems.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

Python Basics:

Understand why Python programming is powerful and versatile.
Comprehend the significance of indentation in Python syntax.
Control Flow:

Implement if, if...else, and elif statements to make decisions in your code.
Use while and for loops to repeat tasks efficiently.
Differentiate between Pythonâ€™s for loops and those in C.
Loop Enhancements:

Utilize break and continue statements to control loop execution.
Implement else clauses in loops to add extra logic after loops complete.
Understand the use of the pass statement as a placeholder in loops or conditionals.
Use the range() function to generate sequences of numbers.
Functions:

Define and call functions to encapsulate reusable logic.
Understand what happens when a function has no return statement.
Manage variable scope within functions.
Understand how Python's traceback works for debugging errors.
Miscellaneous:

Use arithmetic operators for mathematical operations.
Requirements
Python Scripts:
Python 3.8.5 is used for all scripts, running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Scripts must be executable and end with a new line.
The first line of each script should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
Code should adhere to the pycodestyle (2.8.*) style guide.
C Scripts:
Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with GCC using -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Must follow the Betty style guide.
Functions should be defined in a header file named lists.h, with include guards.
Tasks Overview
The project consists of several mandatory and optional tasks that range from basic Python scripts to more complex functions and loops. Below is a summary of some key tasks:

Positive anything is better than negative nothing:

Write a script to determine if a random number is positive, zero, or negative.
The last digit:

Write a script to print the last digit of a random number and classify it.
I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game:

Print the lowercase alphabet without storing characters in a variable or using any modules.
Hexadecimal printing:

Write a script to print numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format.
00...99:

Print all numbers from 0 to 99, ensuring proper formatting with two digits.
Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need:

Write a script to print all possible combinations of two different digits.
